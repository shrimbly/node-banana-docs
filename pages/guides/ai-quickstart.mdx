# AI Quickstart

Node Banana's AI Quickstart feature lets you generate complete workflows from natural language descriptions or choose from preset templates. This guide shows you how to use it effectively.

## Opening AI Quickstart

Click the **AI Quickstart** button in the header or look for the quickstart panel when you first open Node Banana.

## Preset Templates

Choose from 6 built-in templates optimized for common use cases:

### Product Shot
Generate professional product photography with custom backgrounds.
- **Inputs needed**: Product image
- **Output**: Styled product shot

### Model + Product
Create compositions with a model holding or wearing your product.
- **Inputs needed**: Model image, product image
- **Output**: Combined composition

### Color Variations
Generate multiple color variations of a product or design.
- **Inputs needed**: Source image
- **Output**: Multiple color variants

### Background Swap
Replace the background of an image with a new scene.
- **Inputs needed**: Subject image
- **Output**: Image with new background

### Style Transfer
Apply an artistic style to your images.
- **Inputs needed**: Content image
- **Output**: Stylized image

### Scene Composite
Combine multiple elements into a cohesive scene.
- **Inputs needed**: Multiple source images
- **Output**: Composite image

## Custom Workflow Generation

Don't see what you need? Describe your workflow in plain English. You can also describe video generation workflows — just mention "video" in your description and the AI will use Generate Video nodes.

### Writing Good Descriptions

Be specific about:
- What inputs you'll provide
- What transformations you want
- What output you expect

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

**Good example:**
```
Create a workflow that takes a portrait photo, uses an LLM to
generate three different professional background descriptions,
then generates three variations of the portrait with those
backgrounds.
```

**Too vague:**
```
Make something cool with my photos
```

### How It Works

1. Enter your description
2. Click **Generate Workflow**
3. The AI analyzes your request
4. A complete workflow appears on the canvas
5. Review and modify as needed

  Generated workflows may need adjustment. Review prompts and connections before running to ensure they match your intent.

## Using Sample Images

AI Quickstart includes sample images for testing:

- Portrait photos
- Product images
- Backgrounds
- Objects and props

These help you test workflows before using your own images.

## Tips for Best Results

### Start Simple
Begin with a preset template, then modify it rather than generating complex workflows from scratch.

### Review Before Running
Always check:
- Prompt content in each node
- Connection order and logic
- Provider and model selection (Gemini, Replicate, or fal.ai)
- Model-specific parameters

### Iterate
Use Quickstart as a starting point. Add nodes, adjust connections, and refine prompts to get exactly what you want.

### Save Good Workflows
When you create something useful, save it for reuse. Your saved workflows are often more valuable than regenerating.

## Troubleshooting Quickstart

### Workflow doesn't match description
The AI interprets your description as best it can. Try:
- Being more specific
- Breaking complex requests into steps
- Using a preset template as a base

### Missing nodes
If expected nodes are missing, add them manually and connect them into the workflow.

### Prompts need adjustment
Generated prompts are starting points. Edit them to be more specific to your actual use case.
