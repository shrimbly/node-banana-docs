# Models & Pricing

This guide covers the AI models available in Node Banana and their associated costs.

## Multi-Provider Support

Node Banana supports multiple AI providers for image and video generation:

- **Gemini** — Google's image generation models
- **Replicate** — Wide selection of community and custom models
- **fal.ai** — Fast inference for popular models

Configure API keys for each provider in **Project Settings → Providers** tab.

## Image Generation Models

|---------|-------|
| **API Model** | gemini-2.5-flash-image |
| **Resolution** | 1K only |
| **Speed** | Fast |
| **Cost** | $0.039 per image |
| **Best for** | Testing, iteration, drafts |

### nano-banana-pro

The premium model for high-quality output.

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **API Model** | gemini-3-pro-image-preview |
| **Resolution** | 1K, 2K, 4K |
| **Speed** | Slower |
| **Cost** | $0.134 - $0.24 per image |
| **Best for** | Final renders, high-res output |

#### Pro Model Resolution Pricing

| Resolution | Cost per Image |
|------------|---------------|
| 1K | $0.134 |
| 2K | $0.134 |
| 4K | $0.240 |

#### Google Search Feature

The Pro model can use Google Search to inform generation:
- Enables current, real-world references
- Useful for recognizable subjects
- Toggle in node settings

### Replicate & fal.ai Models

Replicate and fal.ai provide access to a wide variety of image generation models:

- **Model Discovery** — Browse available models via the Model Search dialog
- **Dynamic Parameters** — Each model exposes its own configuration options
- **Image-to-Image** — Many models support image input for style transfer and modifications
- **Pricing** — Varies by model; check provider documentation for current rates
- **Recently Used** — Quick access to your frequently used models

Use the model selector in Generate Image nodes to browse and search available models from all providers.

## Video Generation Models

Video generation is available through compatible models on Replicate and fal.ai providers.

### Features
- **Extended processing** — 10-minute timeout for video generation
- **Format support** — Automatic handling of various video formats
- **Video preview** — In-node and Output node video playback
- **Carousel history** — Browse previous video generations

### Pricing Considerations

Video generation typically:
- Takes longer than image generation (minutes vs. seconds)
- Costs more per generation
- Varies significantly by model and video length
- Check specific model pricing on provider websites

### Choosing Video Models

When selecting a video model, consider:
- **Duration** — Longer videos cost more
- **Resolution** — Higher resolution increases cost and processing time
- **FPS** — Frame rate affects both quality and cost
- **Provider** — Compare pricing between Replicate and fal.ai

## Cost Tracking

### Viewing Costs

Node Banana tracks costs in several places:

1. **Header** — Shows total workflow cost
2. **Node preview** — Shows estimated cost before running
3. **Generation history** — Tracks cost per generation

### How Costs Are Calculated

- **Before running**: Estimated based on model and settings
- **After running**: Actual cost recorded
- **Cumulative**: All costs tracked across sessions

### Managing Costs

**Tips to reduce costs:**

1. **Use nano-banana for testing** — It's ~3x cheaper than Pro
2. **Lower resolution** — 1K is often sufficient for iteration
3. **Batch carefully** — Review prompts before running multiple generations
4. **Lock groups** — Skip unnecessary nodes during partial runs

## Choosing the Right Model

### For Iteration/Testing
- Model: nano-banana
- Resolution: 1K
- Cost: ~$0.04/image

### For Quality Previews
- Model: nano-banana-pro
- Resolution: 2K
- Cost: ~$0.13/image

### For Final Output
- Model: nano-banana-pro
- Resolution: 4K
- Google Search: If beneficial
- Cost: ~$0.24/image

## Aspect Ratios

Both models support these aspect ratios:

| Ratio | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| 1:1 | Square, social media |
| 16:9 | Landscape, presentations |
| 9:16 | Portrait, stories, mobile |
| 4:3 | Standard photos |
| 3:4 | Portrait photos |
| 3:2 | Classic photography |
| 2:3 | Vertical prints |
| 4:5 | Instagram portrait |
| 5:4 | Medium format |
| 21:9 | Ultrawide, cinematic |
