## Cost Tracking

### Viewing Costs

Node Banana tracks costs in several places:

1. **Header** — Shows total workflow cost
2. **Node preview** — Shows estimated cost before running
3. **Generation history** — Tracks cost per generation

### How Costs Are Calculated

- **Before running**: Estimated based on model and settings
- **After running**: Actual cost recorded
- **Cumulative**: All costs tracked across sessions

### Managing Costs

**Tips to reduce costs:**

1. **Use nano-banana for testing** — It's ~3x cheaper than Pro
2. **Lower resolution** — 1K is often sufficient for iteration
3. **Batch carefully** — Review prompts before running multiple generations
4. **Lock groups** — Skip unnecessary nodes during partial runs
