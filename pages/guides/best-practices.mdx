# Best Practices

This guide covers tips and patterns for getting the most out of Node Banana.

## Workflow Organization

### Name Your Nodes
Click node titles to give them meaningful names. Instead of "Prompt" and "Prompt 2", use "Subject Description" and "Style Instructions".

### Use Comments
Add comments to complex nodes explaining their purpose. Future you will thank present you.

### Group Related Nodes
Create groups for logical sections:
- Input processing
- Generation pipeline
- Output handling

### Left-to-Right Flow
Organize workflows so data flows left to right. This matches reading direction and makes workflows easier to understand.

## Prompt Writing

### Be Specific
Vague prompts get vague results. Include:
- Subject details
- Style and mood
- Lighting conditions
- Camera perspective
- Technical specifications

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

**Instead of:**
```
A cat
```

**Write:**
```
A fluffy orange tabby cat sitting on a windowsill,
golden hour sunlight streaming in, shallow depth of field,
professional pet photography, warm tones
```

### Use Structure

For complex prompts, organize into sections:
```
Subject: [what you're generating]
Style: [artistic style or technique]
Composition: [framing, angle, layout]
Lighting: [light source, mood, time of day]
Technical: [camera settings, render quality]
```

### Negative Space
Mention what you don't want:
```
...clean background, no text, no watermarks
```

### Iterate on Prompts
1. Start with a basic prompt
2. Generate and evaluate
3. Add details for what's missing
4. Remove details that cause issues
5. Save your refined prompt

## Working with Images

### Image Quality Matters
- Use high-resolution source images
- Avoid heavily compressed JPEGs
- Clean, well-lit photos work best

### Annotation Best Practices
When annotating images for AI reference:
- Use bright, contrasting colors
- Keep annotations clear and simple
- Circle or highlight, don't obscure
- The AI sees exactly what you draw

### Reference Images
When providing reference images to Nano Banana:
- Include images that show what you want
- Multiple references can guide style, composition, color
- Conflicting references may confuse the model

## Execution Strategies

### Test Before Batch
Before running a full workflow:
1. Run just the first generation node
2. Check the output
3. Adjust prompts if needed
4. Then run the complete workflow

### Use Locked Groups
Lock groups containing completed work. This:
- Prevents accidental re-execution
- Speeds up partial runs
- Preserves successful generations

### Run From Node
Use the play button on individual nodes to:
- Re-run specific sections
- Test changes without full execution
- Debug connection issues

## Cost Management

### Iterate Cheaply
Use nano-banana (not Pro) while iterating. Switch to Pro only for final outputs.

### Check Before Running
Review estimated costs in the header before executing large workflows.

### Monitor Cumulative Costs
Track your spending across sessions. Set mental budgets for projects.

## File Management

### Consistent Naming
Name workflow files descriptively:
- `product-shot-workflow.json`
- `portrait-style-transfer-v2.json`

### Version Your Workflows
When making significant changes, save as a new version rather than overwriting.

### Organize by Project
Create folders for different projects or clients.

## Common Patterns

### Prompt Enhancement Pipeline
```
[Your Prompt] → [LLM: Enhance this prompt] → [Nano Banana]
```
Use an LLM to expand simple prompts into detailed generation instructions.

### A/B Testing
```
                    ┌→ [Nano Banana: Model A]
[Prompt] → [Split] ─┤
                    └→ [Nano Banana: Model B]
```
Compare different models or settings on the same prompt.

### Iterative Refinement
```
[Image] → [Annotate: Mark changes] → [Nano Banana: Apply changes]
```
Draw on images to guide refinements.

### Multi-Style Generation
```
                           ┌→ [Prompt: Style 1] → [Generate]
[Base Prompt] → [LLM] ─────┼→ [Prompt: Style 2] → [Generate]
                           └→ [Prompt: Style 3] → [Generate]
```
Generate multiple style variations from one concept.

## Troubleshooting Workflows

### Check Connections
- Ensure handle types match (image→image, text→text)
- Verify all inputs are connected
- Look for disconnected nodes

### Review Node States
- Red border = error (check console)
- Spinning = still processing
- Idle = ready to run

### Isolate Problems
If a workflow fails:
1. Find the failing node
2. Run just that node
3. Check its inputs
4. Review its settings
