# Your First Workflow

This tutorial walks you through creating a simple image generation workflow. By the end, you'll understand the basics of adding nodes, connecting them, and running a workflow.

## What We'll Build

A simple two-node workflow that generates an image from a text prompt:

```
[Prompt] → [Generate] → Generated Image
```

## Step 1: Add a Prompt Node

1. Look at the **floating action bar** at the bottom of the screen
2. Click the **Prompt** button (or press `Shift + P`)
3. A prompt node appears on the canvas

The prompt node has:
- A text input area for your prompt
- An expand button to open a larger editor
- A **text output handle** (small circle) on the right side

## Step 2: Add a Generate Image Node

1. Click the **Generate** button in the action bar (or press `Shift + G`)
2. A Generate Image node appears on the canvas
3. Drag it to the right of your prompt node

The Generate Image node has:
- **Input handles** on the left (for images and text)
- **Output handle** on the right (for the generated image)
- Provider and model selection dropdown
- Dynamic parameters based on selected model
- Custom configuration options

## Step 3: Connect the Nodes

1. Click and drag from the **text output** (right side of Prompt node)
2. Drag to the **text input** (left side of Generate node)
3. Release to create a connection

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  Connections only work between compatible types: text-to-text and image-to-image. You can't connect a text output to an image input.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Write Your Prompt

1. Click inside the prompt node's text area
2. Type a description of the image you want to generate:

```
A golden retriever puppy sitting in a field of sunflowers,
soft afternoon lighting, professional photography
```

## Step 5: Configure the Generator

1. **Provider**: Start with "Gemini" (default)
2. **Model**: Select a model like "nano-banana" for faster, cheaper generation
3. **Parameters**: Configure model-specific options (aspect ratio, resolution, etc.)

<Callout type="tip">
  Start with Gemini's "nano-banana" model while testing. You can explore other providers and models using the model search dialog for different capabilities and styles.
</Callout>

## Step 6: Run the Workflow

You have several options to run:

- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to run the entire workflow
- Click the **Run** button in the header
- Click the play button on an individual node to run from that point

When running:
1. Nodes execute in dependency order
2. The current node shows a loading state
3. Results appear when generation completes

## Step 7: View Your Result

After generation completes:
- The generated image appears in the generate node
- Click the image to open a larger preview
- Use the **carousel arrows** to browse generation history
- Right-click to download the image

## Adding an Output Node

For a cleaner workflow, add an Output node:

1. Click **Output** in the action bar
2. Connect the generate node's image output to the output node
3. The output node gives you a dedicated preview area with download options

## Saving Your Workflow

1. Click the **menu icon** in the header
2. Select **Save** (or press `Cmd/Ctrl + S`)
3. Choose a location and filename
4. Your workflow saves as a `.json` file
