# Introduction

Node Banana is a visual workflow editor designed for AI image generation. It allows you to create, connect, and execute nodes on an infinite canvas to build complex image processing pipelines.

## Why Node Banana?

Traditional AI image generation tools often require you to work with single images one at a time. Node Banana takes a different approach:

- **Visual workflows** — See your entire pipeline at a glance
- **Reusable pipelines** — Save and reuse complex workflows
- **Batch processing** — Process multiple images through the same pipeline
- **Iterative refinement** — Annotate and re-generate images without starting over
- **Cost awareness** — Track your API spending in real-time

## Use Cases

### Product Photography
Create consistent product shots by building a workflow that takes your product images and generates professional compositions with custom backgrounds and lighting.

### Style Transfer
Build pipelines that apply consistent styling across multiple images — perfect for creating cohesive visual content.

### Image Variations
Generate multiple variations of a concept by connecting a single prompt to multiple generation nodes with different settings.

### Composite Creation
Combine multiple input images with annotations and AI generation to create complex composite images.

## How It Works

1. **Add nodes** to the canvas — each node performs a specific function
2. **Connect nodes** by dragging between handles — data flows through connections
3. **Configure nodes** with your settings, prompts, and images
4. **Run the workflow** — nodes execute in dependency order
5. **View results** in output nodes or image carousels

## System Requirements

- **Browser**: Chrome (recommended), Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **Internet**: Required for AI generation (API calls)
- **API Keys**: Google Gemini API key (required), OpenAI API key (optional)
